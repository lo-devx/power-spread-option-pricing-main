    "• Kirk’s Approximation only works for one expiry payoff, not hourly decisions.\n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000 paths gives a 1 month UK–FR spread option value of €16.58/MWh, in line with Kirk’s Approximation (€16.59/MWh).\n",
    "\n",
    "The close agreement validates our volatility, correlation, and expiry inputs, and shows that both analytical and numerical approaches converge on the same fair value.\n",
    "For a 1 GW interconnector over a month (720 hours), this equates to a notional value of ~€11.95 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Kirk & Monte Carlo Results\n",
    "- Raw market data: UK mean = ~€81.10/MWh, FR mean = ~€68.06/MWh\n",
    "- Average spread ≈ €13.04/MWh\n",
    "\n",
    "### View:\n",
    "- If you always flowed in one direction, we’d expect => €13.04/MWh ≈ €9.36m/month for 1 GW.\n",
    "- But this ignores volatility and the ability to choose direction each hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optionality view (Kirk & Monte Carlo):\n",
    "- Kirk ≈ €16.58/MWh\n",
    "- Monte Carlo ≈ €16.59/MWh\n",
    "- Both methods converge, validating inputs and model.\n",
    "- Scaling: 1 GW × 720 hours × €16.6/MWh = €11.95m/month.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why value > average spread:\n",
    "- Capacity is an option: you only flow when profitable, never when it’s negative.\n",
    "- Volatility + low correlation make optionality more valuable than the mean spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why traders pay this:\n",
    "- €11.95m/month is the fair value, a benchmark and not a guaranteed profit.\n",
    "- Traders pay because capacity is scarce and strategic.\n",
    "- Edge comes from views (higher volatility, diverging markets, policy shifts).\n",
    "- If realised spreads are wilder than history, the true value can be well above €16.6/MWh.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**: The raw directional spread implied €9.36m/month, while the option value is €11.95m/month due to volatility and correlation effects. Traders pay this premium because interconnector capacity is scarce and provides optionality - the ability to monetise hourly market divergence above fair value.”"
