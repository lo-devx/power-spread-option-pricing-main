    "• Kirk’s Approximation only works for one expiry payoff, not hourly decisions.\n",
    "• Monte Carlo can handle both: in our case we use a 1-step GBM version (just expiry), but in reality you’d need a multi-step simulation to capture daily/hourly exercise."

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000 paths gives a 1 month UK–FR spread option value of €6.70/MWh, in line with Kirk’s Approximation (€6.71/MWh).\n",
    "\n",
    "The close agreement validates our volatility, correlation, and expiry inputs, and shows that both analytical and numerical approaches converge on the same fair value.\n",
    "For a 1 GW interconnector over a month (720 hours), this equates to a notional value of ~€4.8 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation of Kirk & Monte Carlo Results\n",
    "• Raw market data: UK mean = ~€82/MWh, FR mean = ~€78/MWh\n",
    "• Average spread ≈ €4/MWh\n",
    "\n",
    "## View:\n",
    "• If you always flowed in one direction, we’d expect => €4/MWh ≈ €3m/month for 1 GW.\n",
    "• But this ignores volatility and the ability to choose direction each hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optionality view (Kirk & Monte Carlo):\n",
    "• Kirk ≈ €6.71/MWh\n",
    "• Monte Carlo ≈ €6.70/MWh\n",
    "• Both methods converge, validating inputs and model.\n",
    "• Scaling: 1 GW × 720 hours × €6.7/MWh ≈ €4.8m/month.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why value > average spread:\n",
    "• Capacity is an option: you only flow when profitable, never when it’s negative.\n",
    "• Volatility + low correlation make optionality more valuable than the mean spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why traders pay this:\n",
    "• €4.8m/month is the fair value, a benchmark and not a guaranteed profit.\n",
    "• Traders pay because capacity is scarce and strategic.\n",
    "• Edge comes from views (higher volatility, diverging markets, policy shifts).\n",
    "• If realised spreads are wilder than history, the true value can be well above €6.7/MWh.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "=> The raw spread suggested €3m/month, but the option value is €4.8m/month because of volatility and correlation. Traders pay that because capacity is scarce, and they believe their market view lets them monetise the optionality above fair value.”"
